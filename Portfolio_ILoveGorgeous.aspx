    Site re-build and on-going marketing programme & support.<br />
    A new site was commissioned to drive e-commerce sales and showcase the intricate
    designs. Being a relatively young brand, it was important that the site supplied
    sufficient brand information to encourage the first time visitor to purchase, as
    well as offering a stream-lined e-commerce solution. A full on and off-line marketing
    programme has been engineered to support the launch and provide on-going sales momentum.
    Further sites overseas are now also being considered.<br />
    <br />
    Currently enjoying continuing sales growth of over 400%.<br />
