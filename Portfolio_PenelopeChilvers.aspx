     A long term on-site placement with the objective of getting ecommerce sales figures back on track.  The existing site was refreshed and made responsive with a full marketing plan drafted.  PPC management was also undertaken.  Within 5  weeks the figures were showing a successful return and a year long contract followed.<br />

    Anna was very effective in our marketing team.  She was sensitive enough to capture spirit of  the brand, and showed agility in her motivation to market our product beyond the normal routes.
