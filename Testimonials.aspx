        quickly became a hugely succesful part of our retail strategy. She combines a real
        attention to detail with and imaginative approach and was always careful to engage
        her "web novice" colleagues"</span><br />

    <span class="quote">"Anna came in to work drive Anya Hindmarch forward running the eCommerce.
        From the start she provided a breath of fresh air and always had her finger on the
        most important issues. This made an impact on the bottom line and she got there
        from working in partership, which is always stronger. Equally with the luxury fashion
        you always have to protect the brand which can be a difficult balancing act, I would
        recommend her to strike the right balance."</span><br />
